# Todo Points

### Next Steps
- [x] Remove variables that have dwindling impact
--> I skip this for now and remove the two questionable metrics. It also seems that this happens automatically
- [X] Formulate reasonable SLOs
- [X] Find the best config with SLOs respected
- [X] Add energy consumption as another metric
- [X] Get data from Jetson NX with 6 Cores CPU

### Optics
- [X] Reverse arrows from FPS/Pixel to Bitrate
- [X] Remove bitrate --> distance, add fps --> distance
 
### Optional
- [ ] Export to file if training takes too long
