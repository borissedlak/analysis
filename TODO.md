# Todo Points

### Next Steps
- [x] Remove variables that have dwindling impact
--> I skip this for now and remove the two questionable metrics. It also seems that this happens automatically
- [X] Formulate reasonable SLOs
- [X] Find the best config with SLOs respected
- [X] Add energy consumption as another metric
- [ ] Find a way to evaluate model evidence
- [ ] Compare training methods and pick best
- [ ] Get data from Jetson NX with 6 Cores CPU

### Decisions
- [ ] Simulate the GPU data if I didn't get there by Tue EoB
- [ ] Improve the Jetson performance a bit if necessary

### Optics
- [ ] Reverse arrows from FPS/Pixel to Bitrate
- [ ] Remove bitrate to show it without
 
### Optional
- [ ] Export to file if training takes too long
